# Tic-Tac-Toe with Redux
## Website
https://jonnynavi.github.io/Tic-Tac-Toe-Redux/
## Overview
This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game built using **React** and **Redux Toolkit** for state management. The game allows two players to take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid until a player wins or the game ends in a draw. Scores are tracked across multiple rounds.

## Features
- **State Management**: Utilizes Redux Toolkit to handle game logic and scoring.
- **Turn-Based Gameplay**: Players alternate turns until a win or draw is determined.
- **Game Over Panel**: Displays the winner or a draw message and allows for a new game to start.
- **Score Tracking**: Keeps track of wins for both players and total draws.

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tic-tac-toe-redux.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash

   ```
3. Install dependencies:

## Usage

## Redux Store
The application state is managed using Redux Toolkit, with two slices:

### `gameSlice.js`
- Manages the game board, current player, and win conditions.
- Handles move actions and checks for game completion.

### `playersSlice.js`
- Keeps track of player scores and draws.
- Updates scores after each round.

## Dependencies
- **React**
- **Redux Toolkit**
- **React Redux**
- **ReactDOM**
